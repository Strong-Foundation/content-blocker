To add the custom content blocker list to your browser using the provided link, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Link**: First, copy the provided link:

   ```
   chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/asset-viewer.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcomplexorganizations%2Fcontent-blocker%2Fmain%2Fassets%2Fbrowser.txt&title=Custom%20Content%20Blocker%20List&subscribe=1
   ```

2. **Open Your Browser**: Launch the web browser where you want to add this content blocker list.

3. **Paste the Link in a New Tab**: Open a new tab and paste the link into the address bar. Then, press Enter to navigate to that link.

However, it's important to note that the URL format (`chrome-extension://`) suggests that this is a Chrome extension link. Typically, these links don't work directly in browsers due to security restrictions. Extensions are usually added through the official web store (like Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome).

### Blocklists:

Content Blocker utilizes several curated blocklists, each tackling specific categories of unwanted content. Explore the `/assets` folder and choose the ones you want to activate. You can also contribute to the community by reporting new domains or building your own custom list.

### FAQ:

**Q: How does Content Blocker differ from browser extensions?**

A: Browser extensions can be slow, resource-intensive, and vulnerable to manipulation. Content Blocker operates at the DNS level, offering a system-wide, lightweight solution that's harder to bypass.

**Q: Is Content Blocker completely effective?**

A: Content Blocker blocks an enormous range of unwanted content, but no tool is 100% foolproof. New threats emerge constantly, so staying vigilant and keeping your blocklists updated is crucial.

**Q: Can I modify the code?**

A: Absolutely! Content Blocker is open-source, encouraging customization and community contributions. Feel free to fork the repository, tinker with the code, and share your improvements.
